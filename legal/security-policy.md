# Security Policy

**Effective Date: January 1, 2026**

This Security Policy describes the physical and digital measures implemented by **Lands Horizon Corp** (“we”, “us”, or “our”) to protect the assets and information of all users, members, and cooperatives on the **e-coop-suite** platform ([http://ecoop-suite.com/](http://ecoop-suite.com/)). Our security practices are designed to provide robust protection for users on all subscription plans and to comply with applicable laws and best practices.

---

## 1. Purpose and Scope

- To ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of assets, data, and systems on the e-coop-suite platform.
- Applies to all users, members, cooperative organizations, employees, partners, and third-party service providers.

---

## 2. Physical Security Measures

- All servers and core infrastructure are hosted via the **Fly.io Cloud Platform**.
- Physical security and environmental controls (such as access management, surveillance, and disaster prevention) are managed by Fly.io and its global data center partners.
- We rely on Fly.io's compliance with industry standards and certifications for physical data center security.
- Our team and users do not have direct physical access to the data centers where our services are hosted.

---

## 3. Digital Security Measures

- **Encryption:** All sensitive data is encrypted in transit (TLS/SSL) and at rest.
- **Authentication:** Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is required for privileged accounts; strong password policies are enforced.
- **Access Controls:** Role-based access controls (RBAC) restrict access to data and features based on user roles and subscription plans.
- **Password Security:** Passwords are hashed using secure algorithms (e.g., Argon2) and never stored in plain text.
- **Regular Audits:** Security audits, penetration tests, and vulnerability assessments are conducted regularly.
- **Network Security:** Firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and anti-malware tools protect our infrastructure.
- **Session Management:** Automatic timeouts and session controls prevent unauthorized access.
- **Security Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring detects suspicious activity and potential threats.
- **API Security:** All APIs are protected with rate limiting, authentication, and input validation.
- **Application Security:** Protection against threats such as XSS, CSRF, and SQL injection is enforced.
- **Change Management:** All system/code changes are reviewed, tested, and logged before deployment.

## 4. Data Protection and Privacy

- Data is collected, processed, and stored in compliance with the Data Privacy Act of 2012 and relevant local regulations.
- Access to personal and sensitive data is strictly limited, monitored, and logged.
- Data backups are performed regularly and stored securely for recoverability.

---

## 5. Incident Response

- A formal incident response plan is in place for detecting, reporting, and addressing security incidents.
- Users and members are promptly notified of any breaches that may affect their assets or information, in accordance with legal requirements.
- Lessons learned from incidents are used to strengthen controls and prevent recurrence.

---

## 6. Member and User Responsibilities

- Members should use strong, unique passwords and enable MFA where available.
- Sharing of accounts or credentials is strictly prohibited.
